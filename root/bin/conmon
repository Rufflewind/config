# NAME
#        conmon - Restart service when some criterion fails
#
# SYNOPSIS
#        conmon <profile>
#
# DESCRIPTION
#        Polls a user-defined `check` command periodically.  On failure, the
#        user-defined `restart` command is called.
#
#        The time between periodic checks is at least `interval` seconds.
#        There are some additional delays between the restarts to allow the
#        service to act and to prevent frequent but futile restarts during
#        extended outages.  These timings can be adjusted via the `init_pause`
#        and `max_pause` parameters.
#
#        The script must be run as root.  To reduce the risk of this, `check`
#        is executed as `nobody`.  This can be configured using the `user`
#        parameter.
#
# OPTIONS
#        <profile>
#               Name of the profile script, corresponding to
#               /etc/conmon/<profile>.conf.
#
# EXAMPLE
#        A profile that tests Internet connectivity and restarts wlp3s0 on
#        failure:
#
#          # /etc/conmon/wlp3s0.conf
#
#          interval=300   # in seconds
#          #user=nobody   # user under which `check` is run
#          #init_pause=30 # in seconds
#          #max_pause=600 # in seconds
#
#          check() { # must return 0 on success
#              ping -c 5 -W 300 google.com >/dev/null
#          }
#
#          restart() {
#              systemctl restart netctl-auto@wlp3s0
#          }
#
#        The script itself may be managed via a systemd unit template:
#
#          # /etc/systemd/system/conmon@.service
